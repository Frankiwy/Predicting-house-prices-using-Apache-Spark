The goal of this assignment is to predict the price of a house based on given set of features. It is
an attempt to a Kaggle competition titled "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"1.This
is a regression task, meaning that the target variable is a numeric (continuous value), so instead
of recognizing patterns we recognize trends.
